Input: Fuck you

Input: If you have me scheduled in meetings all day when do you expect me to get this work done?
Output: My calendar is currently heavily scheduled with meetings. To ensure appropriate time is available to get this done I can sit out of lower priority meetings this week or extend the deadline on this project. Please let me know which is preferred.
Input: You're not my boss, stop trying to assign me work
Output: Have you connected with [insert managers hame] in regards to me taking this on? As it has not been communicated to me that I will be working on this.
Input: I am getting underpaid for what my role has evolved into
Output: As my role has organically evolved, can we schedule time to review my overall compensation and discuss whether or not it is still aligned with my current role and responsibilities?
Input: How many times do I need to tell you this?
Output: I encourage you to write down this information to refer back to in the future instead of relying on me to communicate it again.
Input: Why would I go into the office if I can do my job from here?
Output: Can you help me understand why I am required to be in the office when I can effectively execute my job responsibilities remotely?
Input: I told you so and now this is your problem
Output: I did previously note that this was a likely outcome. How do you plan to resolve this?
Input: Try problem solving on your own before you come to me
Output: I encourage you to brainstorm possible solutions prior to looping me in for additional support

Output: Being respectful of time let's regroup when more details become available
Input: While I'm on vacation don't try to contact me. Pretend I don' exists
Output: While I am off I will not be reachable so please do not expect a response. I have CC'd [insert name] as a contact point while l'm off
Input: Stop following up every 20 minutes. Iâ€™ll get back to you when I can
Output: I would appreciate your patience, as I need time to address this. I will provide an update once one is available
